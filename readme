This project provides a simple Python implementation for enhancing underwater images. It addresses common issues like color distortion, low contrast, and noise, resulting in visually clearer and more natural-looking images.
---
## **Features**
- **White Balance Adjustment:** Corrects color distortion caused by underwater light absorption.
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Uses Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for improved visibility.
- **Noise Reduction:** Reduces image noise using fast non-local means denoising.
---
## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
 - OpenCV
Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
